# ecomdemo – Agent Notes

## Goals
- Keep changes vanilla (plain HTML/CSS/JS).
- Small diffs; no framework migrations.
- Prefer minimal dependencies.
- Always run via a local web server (no file:// testing).

## Safety
- Do not add real payment handling.
- Do not store real PII.
- If you add tracking/events, document exactly what changed.

## Workflow
- Before changes: summarize current behavior.
- After changes: list files changed + how to test.
